  "strengths": [
    "• Strong use of action verbs such as Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Streamlined, and Mentored throughout the experience section.",
    "• Demonstrates full‑stack expertise across a wide range of modern technologies (Laravel, Node.js, React, Vue, Docker, AWS, Azure).",
    "• Includes measurable results in several bullet points (e.g., 50% reduction in deployment time, 50% traffic increase, team of 5 developers).",
    "• Shows continuous learning and certification (Google Ads Video, Cybersecurity program).",
    "• Clear chronological work history with dates, making it easy for ATS to parse employment timelines."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "• No professional summary or headline that ties the candidate’s senior‑level value proposition to the target role.",
    "• Target industry keywords list (python, java, c#, go, etc.) is largely missing; only PHP and JavaScript appear.",
    "• Quantification is limited to a few bullet points; many achievements lack numbers, percentages, or impact statements.",
    "• Certifications are embedded in the Achievements section instead of a dedicated Certifications heading, reducing visibility for ATS.",
    "• Leadership and management details are sparse; senior roles typically require explicit mention of team size, budget, or project scope."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "• Add a concise professional summary (3‑4 lines) that includes senior‑level keywords such as “lead”, “architect”, “strategic”, and mentions core languages like JavaScript, PHP, and any additional languages you have experience with.",
    "• Incorporate missing high‑value keywords from the target list (e.g., Python, Java, TypeScript, Go) by adding relevant projects or brief statements of familiarity.",
    "• Quantify more achievements: add metrics for page‑load improvements, cost savings, user adoption rates, or revenue impact where possible.",
    "• Create a separate Certifications section and list the Google Ads Video certification, any AWS/Azure certifications, and the Cybersecurity program to improve keyword hits.",
    "• Highlight leadership responsibilities: specify “Led a team of X developers”, “Managed a budget of $Y”, or “Oversaw delivery of Z‑month projects” to align with senior‑level expectations."

  "detailedInsights": {
    "keywordAnalysis": "The resume contains strong keywords for full‑stack web development (Laravel, Node.js, React, Vue, Docker, AWS) but falls short on the specific language list provided for the senior technology role. Only PHP and JavaScript (implicitly via Node.js and React) match the target set. Adding any experience with Python, Java, C#, Go, TypeScript, or other listed languages—even at a basic or project level—will raise the keyword density score dramatically. Also, include senior‑level buzzwords such as “architect”, “scalable”, “microservices”, and “CI/CD pipeline” to capture more ATS weight.",
    "structureAnalysis": "The resume follows a logical order: contact information, skills, professional experience, education, and achievements. Headings are clearly labeled, which aids ATS parsing. However, the lack of a dedicated professional summary and certifications section creates gaps for ATS to capture a concise candidate snapshot. Adding those sections will improve structure consistency and make the document more ATS‑friendly.",
    "contentAnalysis": "Content is written in an active voice with strong verbs and generally clear language. Technical accomplishments are described with appropriate detail, but many statements are qualitative rather than quantitative. Adding specific numbers (e.g., “Reduced page load time by 35%”, “Handled 200+ concurrent users”) will increase impact. The education entries are complete, but the institution name for the bachelor's degree contains a typo (Kharga vs. Khalsa) that could affect keyword matching.",
    "industryAlignment": "The candidate’s experience aligns well with modern web development and cloud‑based SaaS solutions, which is relevant for senior technology roles. However, the resume does not explicitly address broader senior‑level responsibilities such as system architecture, cross‑functional leadership, budgeting, or strategic planning. Incorporating those elements will better match senior‑level expectations in the technology sector.",
    "atsCompatibility": "Overall ATS compatibility is good because the resume uses plain text headings, chronological dates, and clear bullet‑style statements. The ATS will successfully extract contact details, skill keywords, and employment history. Weaknesses that could hinder parsing include the missing professional summary (often used as a primary keyword block) and the embedding of certifications within achievements. Adding dedicated sections and expanding keyword coverage will raise the ATS score."

  "sectionAnalysis": {
    "contactInfo": "Contact information includes name, city, phone, email, and LinkedIn URL—all essential fields for ATS. No issues detected. Consider adding a professional title (e.g., Senior Full‑Stack Engineer) directly after the name to reinforce the target role.",
    "professionalSummary": "Missing. ATS systems look for a summary block to capture high‑impact keywords and a concise value proposition. Add a 3‑sentence summary that highlights senior‑level experience, core technologies (PHP, JavaScript, cloud), and leadership capabilities.",
    "experience": "Work experience is well‑structured with company name, role, and dates. Action verbs are strong and varied. Quantification exists in a few bullets but should be expanded across all roles. Include explicit leadership metrics (team size, budget, project scope) to demonstrate senior‑level impact.",
    "education": "Both education entries are present with institution, location, and dates. The cybersecurity program is recent and relevant. Ensure the degree name and institution are spelled correctly (Khalsa College) to avoid keyword mismatches.",
    "skills": "Skills section lists a broad set of technologies, but it is presented as a paragraph rather than a concise list. Convert to a bullet or comma‑separated list for easier ATS extraction. Add any missing target keywords (Python, Java, TypeScript, Go, etc.) if you have exposure.",
    "certifications": "Certifications are not in a dedicated section; they appear under Achievements. Create a separate Certifications heading and list Google Ads Video, any cloud certifications, and the cybersecurity program to improve visibility.",
    "achievements": "Achievements include awards and a certification, but they are mixed with project descriptions. Separate awards from certifications, and quantify the impact of the award‑winning projects where possible."
